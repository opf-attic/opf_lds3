To use these unit tests you need Graphite from http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk

Then you need to change the two includes in all the places they occur in all the files to point at your version of Graphite. 

Currently these lines are:

include_once('libraries/Graphite/Graphite.php');
include_once('libraries/arc2/ARC2.php');
